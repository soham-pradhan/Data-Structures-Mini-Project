# Data-Structures-Mini-Project
A schedule managing system which uses data structures using C

PROBLEM DEFINITION:
  ● To design a timetable using c programming language, in such a way that
    students could manage their homework and assignments by using the 
    program.
  ● The time table should be designed in such a way that more preference
    should be given to subjects having submissions dates earlier.
  ● If the submission dates are same , more preference should be given to a
    particular subject that can be done in less time.
  ● looking at the date of submission and the total no of assignments or
    homework the time table should be able to tell the student the order in
    which he/she needs to do the work.
  ● The c program must use appropriate data structures for various options
    provided in the program.
  ● The program must display the time table ,insert tasks, delete tasks, sort,
    calculate reverse, split and merge the tasks.
  ● The program must display time table using basic graphics functions such as
    flood fill, setfillstyle,
    Rectangle , outtextxy.
  ● The program must compare the time recquired and the date of submission
    of two different assignments , and decide accordingly which task is to be
    completed first .
  ● While doing so the program must give priority to both the submission and
    time taken to complete and decide accordingly.
